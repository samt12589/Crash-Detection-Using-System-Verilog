# Crash Detection Using System Verilog
 For this project in system verilog we used an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and the built-in VGA controller to detect and represent on the display if we have an incoming object close to the sensor. 

You can download all the files and use them in intel quartus prime lite edition.
The board used for the project was DE10 Max Lite.
